# DND-Character-Generation
A DND character generator which allows the user to either randomly generate, or input their own, character name, race, gender, class, and stats.

To run this application you will need to have Selenium installed, along with the chrome webdriver that corresponds to your version of chrome. Additionally, when running this application you will notice that Selenium is not running in headless mode, therefore when selecting a random name for your DND character, Selenium will open a chrome webpage. This is due to "Fantasy Name Generator" not allowing automated scraping.
